# jlmenu
A custom cheat menu made for Grand Theft Auto V back in 2016. It should no longer work as much has changed since.

It's public now as it could contain some useful code for some to use. Such as a basic DirectX renderer with ImGui integration, input hook and the hooking methods we used. These should still work in the latest versions.
